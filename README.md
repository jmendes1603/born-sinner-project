# 📊 Born Sinner — A Data-Driven Look at Crime and Socioeconomic Factors in the US

## Project Overview

This project explores the persistent and damaging narrative that links race — particularly Black identity — with inherent criminality in the United States. Using public data, R for analysis, and Tableau for visual storytelling, this project challenges that idea and investigates how **socioeconomic factors** such as income, unemployment, and education correlate more strongly with crime rates than race.

The project is named **Born Sinner**, inspired by J. Cole’s song of the same name, reflecting the theme of societal judgment and personal redemption.

## 🔍 Project Motivation

Many public beliefs about race and crime rely on misleading data interpretations or biased policing practices. For example:
- Black Americans and White Americans use drugs at similar rates, but Black Americans are arrested far more often.
- White-collar crimes in wealthier communities are often underreported.

This project aims to:
1. **Challenge the racial-crime narrative** using data.
2. **Highlight socioeconomic conditions** as more accurate predictors of crime.
3. **Empower underserved communities** through insights into the impact of education, income, and opportunity.

## 📊 Key Dashboard Insights

- **Crime vs Income**  
  Boxplot reveals a clear **negative correlation** between income and crime.

- **Crime vs Unemployment**  
  Positive correlation is observed — higher unemployment generally means higher crime rates.

- **Crime vs Education**  
  States with lower educational attainment (e.g., not completing 9th grade) tend to have higher crime rates.

- **Race vs Crime**  
  No consistent pattern showing that a state’s racial makeup alone predicts its crime rate. E.g., high-crime states like Kentucky have low racial diversity.

## ✊ Target Audience

This dashboard was designed primarily to **empower young Black Americans**. Through clean, transparent visuals, it aims to:
- Challenge harmful stereotypes.
- Highlight how environment, not genetics, shapes crime trends.
- Promote education and economic opportunity as pathways to empowerment.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Bias

- **Data Availability**: Some city-level data were unavailable, so state-level aggregation was used.
- **Bias in Data**: Arrest rates may be influenced by racial profiling and reporting inconsistencies.
- **Simplification**: Focusing on 3–4 key variables helps storytelling but simplifies a complex issue.
